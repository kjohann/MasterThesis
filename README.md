This repository will be the host of all applications and pherhaps also documentation
 of my master thesis at the University of Oslo. Main reports may be excluded from repository.

Description of project:
-----------------------

I am going to test different frameworks for asynch client/server applications like Node.js and SignalR.
They will be compared based on a set of criterias I have yet to define. 

The work will include a testapplication that is to be implemented in each framework. This application
will be an auctionhouse. In this app users should be able to:

* log in/register
* add items for sale
* make bids on items
* get real-time info about items

More specs will possibly be added.
