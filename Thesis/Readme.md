#Extended abstract#
This thesis is the result of a project with two parts. The first part compares five frameworks for real time web applications based on usability. Socket.IO, SignalR, Lightstreamer, Meteor and Play were the five frameworks. I used each framework to implement an auction house with real time capabilities. This allowed me to get an impression of how each framework is to work with. The use of a framework with limited help regarding real time, gave insight into how it is to make real time functionality from scratch.
<br><br>In the second part, load testing of each framework was in focus. SockJS replaced Meteor of practical reasons in this part. The frameworks went through a series of tests to determine performance in message frequency, latency, network and machine resource usage. This part also focuses on comparing the various transport mechanisms for real time. The ultimate goal of this was to find out if WebSockets, a new protocol for real time, is better than HTTP in this matter. I also investigated if WebSockets can replace HTTP for traditional web browsing.
<br><br>Finally, I summarize both parts and conclude the problem statements. I also propose some possible projects that can be based on this thesis.
