#Results - raw data#

This folder contains all the raw data in various JSON-files. The files in the folder "High throughput" has one file for
each transport mechanism. In addition, it has one file for the manual data collected regarding processor usage, memory consumption
and network usage. The file "manualDataWithCalculatedBytes.json" has the same content regarding processor and memory, but not network.
It has network-numbers from the byte calculations described in the thesis. The basis for these is in the "Bytes sent received analysis"-file above. In addition, it has data regarding the average latency for each transport.
The "Custom" folder has JSON-files that combine certain data from the "standard" results. Finally, the "Connections" folder contains some data that isn't relevant for the thesis results directly. They are browser data from test runs conducted with both 1000 and 4500 connected clients. This data was not what I was after with this tests, but I kept them as "proof" for actually running the tests.

##Other raw data##

There are certain other files that are too large to host here. These include network capture files. Any reader of this thesis can get access to these by contacting me.
