#Project part 2: Load tests#

This folder contains all code and results concerning the second part of my project. 


##Problem statements##
Two problem statements from the thesis is about this part. The following text is from the thesis itself:

<b>IV: Does WebSockets outperform the old, established HTTP methods for
real time in terms of network usage, message latency and use of machine
resources? </b>
<br>If it turns out that WebSockets doesnâ€™t perform better, is it something we need?

<b>V: Can WebSockets be the foundation for the next generation of HTTP?</b>
<br>The answer to this is coupled with the previous question. If WebSockets is just as
good as HTTP performancewise, it will not be the foundation for the next generation
of HTTP. However, if it is better, can it change the way browsers communicate with
servers in more aspects than real time?
